# Corruption_Detection_Platform
Nowadays corruption is one of the main problems our country is dealing with.
Many a times a citizen is forced to pay a bribe to get their works done.
Many government project funds disappear and no one knows where it goes and many more such issues.
So to deal with this problem we are team and we have made a approach to built a platform that help people fight corruption with using technology.

Our platform includes its facilities:
(1) It includes anonymous corruption reporting system where citizens can report without any fear.
(2) Transparently showing how government funds and public tax are spent.
(3) System to rate this corruption free businesses and government offices!
(4) A system that spreads awareness and educates people about laws and their rights to fight againstÂ corruptions.
